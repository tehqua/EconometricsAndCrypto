### Introduction to the Project:

- Welcome to our Crypto Analysis App! This project aims to provide users with insights into cryptocurrency prices using advanced analytics techniques. By leveraging SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models, we offer forecasts for cryptocurrency prices along with visualizations of historical data and volume trends.

### How to Use the App:

## Select Page:

Start by selecting the page you want to explore from the sidebar. You can choose between "Crypto Currency Overview" and "Econometrics".
## Crypto Currency Overview:

This page provides real-time prices for various cryptocurrencies.
Select a cryptocurrency from the dropdown menu to view its current price.
Additionally, you can see historical price charts and volume trends for the selected cryptocurrency.
## Econometrics:

In this section, we delve deeper into the econometric analysis of cryptocurrency prices.
Choose a cryptocurrency to analyze from the dropdown menu.
You'll find detailed insights into SARIMA model results, including forecasts, historical data, and volume trends.
The model summary offers a comprehensive overview of the SARIMA model's performance.
Interpreting SARIMAX Results:

On the "Econometrics" page, you'll encounter SARIMAX model results, including key metrics like Log Likelihood, AIC, BIC, and more.
These results provide valuable information about the model's fit to the data, the significance of coefficients, and diagnostic tests for model adequacy.
Be sure to pay attention to warnings and alerts regarding the model's convergence and assumptions.
